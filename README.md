SmartBins â€“ IoT Garbage Monitoring System
Project Overview
SmartBins is an IoT-based garbage monitoring solution that automates the measurement and reporting of bin fill levels. Using ultrasonic sensors and a microcontroller, the system wirelessly transmits fill data to a cloud or dashboard, enabling timely waste collection, optimized routes, and cleaner environments.

Features
Real-time monitoring of garbage bin levels with ultrasonic sensors

Automated alerts and LED indicators for full bins

Wireless data transmission (Wi-Fi or GSM supported)

Dashboard-ready for visualizing bin status and collection logs

Scalable for use in cities, universities, and large campuses

Hardware Used
Arduino UNO or ESP32 microcontroller

Ultrasonic Sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)

LEDs with current-limiting resistors

Wi-Fi (ESP32, or ESP8266) or GSM module

Breadboard, wires, power supply

Circuit Diagram

How It Works
Ultrasonic sensors measure the fill level of each bin.

The microcontroller processes sensor data and lights up an LED when a bin is full.

Bin status can be sent wirelessly to a cloud service or dashboard for remote monitoring.

Collection teams receive timely info, ensuring efficient waste pickup.

Getting Started
Assemble the circuit as in the diagram.

Connect each ultrasonic sensor and LED to the assigned pins in your Arduino code.

Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your board.

(Optional) Set up backend/cloud integration for real-time dashboard or app monitoring.
